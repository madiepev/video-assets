## Technical Details

The simulation uses advanced Canvas rendering with optimized algorithms to create real-time wave interference patterns. Each wave source generates expanding ripples that combine mathematically to show constructive (bright) and destructive (dark) interference.

### Wave Equation Used:
```
amplitude Ã— sin(2Ï€ Ã— (frequency Ã— time - distance Ã· wavelength))
```

### Real-World Applications:
- Noise-canceling headphones
- Radio wave propagation
- Medical ultrasound imaging
- Seismology and earthquake analysis
