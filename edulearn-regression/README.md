## üìä Dataset

The simulation uses real-world inspired data showing the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales:

| Temperature (¬∞F) | Ice Cream Sales (units) |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| 65               | 200                     |
| 70               | 250                     |
| 75               | 320                     |
| 80               | 400                     |
| 85               | 480                     |
| 90               | 550                     |
| 95               | 600                     |

**Best Fit Line**: y = 9.5x - 462.5 (approximately)
**R¬≤ Value**: ~0.99 (excellent fit)

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Interaction
1. **Adjust the Line**: Use the slope and y-intercept sliders to move the regression line
2. **Watch the Metrics**: Observe how error metrics change as you adjust the line
3. **Minimize Error**: Try to find the line that minimizes the Sum of Squared Residuals
4. **Check Your Work**: Click "Find Best Fit Line" to see the optimal solution
5. **Toggle Views**: Use checkboxes to show/hide residuals and best fit line

### Educational Workflow
1. **Start with Exploration**: Let students experiment with different slopes and intercepts
2. **Observe Patterns**: Notice how steeper slopes and different intercepts affect the error
3. **Find the Pattern**: Challenge students to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals manually
4. **Reveal the Solution**: Show the best fit line and compare with student attempts
5. **Discuss Results**: Talk about why this line is "best" and what R¬≤ means

    { x: 65, y: 200 },
    { x: 70, y: 250 },
    // Add your points here
    { x: newX, y: newY }
];
```

### Changing Scale Ranges
```javascript
// Modify these values in the constructor
this.xMin = 60;    // Minimum X value
this.xMax = 100;   // Maximum X value
this.yMin = 150;   // Minimum Y value
this.yMax = 650;   // Maximum Y value
```

### Customizing Colors
```css
/* In styles.css, modify CSS custom properties */
:root {
    --primary-blue: #0066CC;
    --accent-orange: #FF6B35;
    --accent-green: #4CAF50;
    --accent-purple: #9C27B0;

## üß™ Educational Extensions

### Advanced Features to Explore
1. **Multiple Regression**: Add a second independent variable
2. **Non-Linear Regression**: Explore polynomial or exponential relationships
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Show uncertainty around the regression line
4. **Cross-Validation**: Split data into training and testing sets
5. **Different Datasets**: Try with different real-world scenarios

### Discussion Questions
1. Why do we square the residuals instead of just using absolute values?
2. What does it mean when R¬≤ is close to 1? Close to 0?
3. How would outliers affect the regression line?
4. When might linear regression not be appropriate?

## üìà Learning Assessment

### Formative Assessment Ideas
- Have students predict the slope before revealing the best fit
- Ask students to identify which line has lower error without showing metrics
- Challenge students to achieve R¬≤ > 0.95 manually

### Summative Assessment Options
- Calculate regression metrics by hand for a subset of data
- Interpret slope and intercept in the context of temperature and ice cream sales
- Explain why the least squares method minimizes prediction errors
