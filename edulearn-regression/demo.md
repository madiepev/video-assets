# Interactive Regression Line Fitting Demo

🎯 **Educational Goal**: Understanding linear regression through hands-on interaction

## Quick Demo Instructions

1. **Open the Simulation**: Launch `index.html` in your browser
2. **Explore the Controls**: Use the slope and y-intercept sliders
3. **Watch the Metrics**: Observe how error values change
4. **Find the Best Fit**: Try to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals
5. **Compare Results**: Click "Find Best Fit Line" to see the optimal solution

## Key Learning Moments

### 🔍 What to Observe
- How changing slope affects the line's angle
- How y-intercept moves the line up and down
- Purple residual lines showing prediction errors
- Real-time error calculations updating

### 🎮 Interactive Challenges
- **Challenge 1**: Get R² above 0.95 manually
- **Challenge 2**: Minimize Sum of Squared Residuals to under 5,000
- **Challenge 3**: Predict the best slope before revealing the answer

### 📊 Educational Context
This simulation uses temperature vs. ice cream sales data to demonstrate:
- **Positive Correlation**: As temperature increases, sales increase
- **Linear Relationship**: The relationship can be modeled with a straight line
- **Prediction Accuracy**: How well our line predicts actual values
- **Mathematical Optimization**: Why least squares method finds the "best" line

## Technical Features

✅ **Real-time error calculations**  
✅ **Smooth animations**  
✅ **Interactive tooltips**  
✅ **Responsive design**  
✅ **Accessibility support**  
✅ **WWL brand compliance**
