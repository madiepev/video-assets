- **Visual Learning**: Color-coded interference patterns make physics concepts tangible

## üéØ Physics Concepts Demonstrated

### Constructive Interference
When wave peaks align, they combine to create **brighter, more intense regions**. The waves reinforce each other, resulting in maximum amplitude areas shown in bright whites and yellows.

### Destructive Interference
When a wave's peak meets another wave's trough, they **cancel each other out**, creating darker, quieter regions shown in deep blues and blacks.

### Wave Properties
- **Frequency**: How many wave cycles occur per second (measured in Hz)
- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement or strength of the wave
- **Wavelength**: The distance between successive wave peaks
- **Phase**: The timing relationship between different waves
